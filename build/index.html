          <h2>User Stories</h2>
          <summary>
            We begin our creative process by asking three fundamental questions about 
            the project: What does it need to look like, who will be using it, and what 
            will they be using it for?
            
          </summary>
          <p>
            We believe that understanding the user is the most fundamental place to 
            start when designing and building a great website. The way we go about 
            this is by devising user stories - we take into consideration everything 
            that the user needs to be able to achieve when using the product, and then 
            use this as the basis for designing both the layout and architecture of 
            the project.

          <h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
          <summary>
            At the very start of the process, we often use rapid prototyping to figure 
            out the best way to design & build a feature. A visual design might look 
            great, but is it easy to use?
            
          </summary>
          <p>
            Rapid Prototyping is the process of quickly mocking up a feature or 
            specific area of functionality, then validating it by testing it with 
            some users to make sure that is intuitive.Once we've determined which 
            one works the best, then we refine it and polish up the design in finer 
            detail.

          <h2>Responsive Development</h2>
          <summary>
            We adopt the 'mobile first' approach to front-end development. The 
            mobile version of the site will be design and built first, and media 
            queries will be used to detect the width of the screen being used, 
            hether mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop.
            
          </summary>
          <p>
            The main benefit to this approach is that it is more future proof; it 
            does not rely on specific devices to function. For example, if a new 
            device is released with an unusual screen ratio, the layout will adjust 
            itself accordingly without any extra development required.

            So this is where we start. We want our websites to look and feel as 
            polished as possible for the majority of users. We focus on the modern

            older browsers, minus the bells & whistles.

            Considering the breadth of devices available to our users, making sure 
            that typography is easy to read at all times is a hugely important 
            factor for a successful website. We set our type in 'ems' so it scales 
            correctly on every device, and we think about type size logically, and 
            test on as many devices as possible to make sure that everything looks 
            perfect across the board.
