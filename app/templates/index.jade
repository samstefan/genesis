    h2 User Stories

    summary.
      We begin our creative process by asking three fundamental questions about 
      the project: What does it need to look like, who will be using it, and what 
      will they be using it for?

    p.
      We believe that understanding the user is the most fundamental place to 
      start when designing and building a great website. The way we go about 
      this is by devising user stories - we take into consideration everything 
      that the user needs to be able to achieve when using the product, and then 
      use this as the basis for designing both the layout and architecture of 
      the project.

    h2 Rapid Prototyping

    summary.
      At the very start of the process, we often use rapid prototyping to figure 
      out the best way to design & build a feature. A visual design might look 
      great, but is it easy to use?

    p.
      Rapid Prototyping is the process of quickly mocking up a feature or 
      specific area of functionality, then validating it by testing it with 
      some users to make sure that is intuitive.Once we've determined which 
      one works the best, then we refine it and polish up the design in finer 
      detail.

    h2 Responsive Development

    summary.
      We adopt the 'mobile first' approach to front-end development. The 
      mobile version of the site will be design and built first, and media 
      queries will be used to detect the width of the screen being used, 
      hether mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop.

    p.
      The main benefit to this approach is that it is more future proof; it 
      does not rely on specific devices to function. For example, if a new 
      device is released with an unusual screen ratio, the layout will adjust 
      itself accordingly without any extra development required.

    h2 Graceful Degradation

    summary.
      Around 90% of the internet is seen on modern, up to date browsers.

    p.
      So this is where we start. We want our websites to look and feel as 
      polished as possible for the majority of users. We focus on the modern 
      browsers first, and then make sure that the site still holds up on the 
      older browsers, minus the bells & whistles.

    h2 Readability

    summary.
      Content should always be inviting.

    p.
      Considering the breadth of devices available to our users, making sure 
      that typography is easy to read at all times is a hugely important 
      factor for a successful website. We set our type in 'ems' so it scales 
      correctly on every device, and we think about type size logically, and 
      test on as many devices as possible to make sure that everything looks 
      perfect across the board.

      Once we've got all of the fundamentals wrapped up, we focus on the small, 
      humanising details that really bring a website to life.

    p.
      We're talking about beautiful iconography, organic interactions, elegant 
      page transitions and so on. These details are the elements that give a 
      project personality and engagement, they need to be well thought out, 
      unobtrusive, and above all, simple
